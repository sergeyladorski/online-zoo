# Online-zoo

Online-zoo is a platform that collects information about animals from various zoos with webcams.
It is assumed that the user can open a page with zoo resources, watch one of the animals, or make a donation that will be used to purchase food.
As part of the task, we have to make an adaptive layout and interactivity of the main page, and the page with donations.
